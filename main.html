            <h2>About Albania</h2>
<b>Albania, or Republika e Shqipërisë (Land of the Eagles) in Albanian, is a developing nation in Southeastern Europe known for its unique culture, mountainous terrain, Adriatic and Ionian coastline, and a complex modern history of isolation and transition. It has recently gained international attention for appointing the world's first cabinet-level AI minister, Diella. <Br><br>
Key Facts</b><br>

    <I>Capital & Largest City: Tirana<br>
    Official Language: Albanian (an independent branch of the Indo-European language family)<br>
    Currency: Albanian Lek (ALL)<br>
    Population: Approximately 2.7 to 3.1 million people (estimates vary)<br>
    Religion: The country is a secular state with a Muslim majority, and significant Orthodox and Catholic Christian minorities. Religious tolerance is a strong cultural element.<br>
    Government: Unitary parliamentary republic<br>
    Membership: Member of NATO since 2009 and an official candidate for European Union (EU) accession. <br>
    Culture and Society<br>
    Albanian culture is highly distinctive:<br>
    Besa: A cultural code of honor emphasizing hospitality and protecting guests.<br>
    Language & Identity: The national symbol is the black double-headed eagle, a legacy of the 15th-century national hero Skanderbeg, who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire.<br>
    Bunkers: The landscape is dotted with hundred of thousands of concrete bunkers built during the isolationist communist regime of Enver Hoxha (1944-1985), some of which have been repurposed into museums and hotels.<br>
    Communication: A unique aspect of local non-verbal communication is that a head shake often means "yes", and a nod means "no", which can be confusing for visitors.</I> </p>
