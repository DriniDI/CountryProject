<h1>Albania: From Ancient Roots to Communist Isolation</h1>

<h2>1. Ottoman rule & the long road to independence (1385–1912)</h2>
<p>
For almost four centuries Albania was a province of the Ottoman Empire.  
Repeated uprisings and the 1878 League of Prizren kept the idea of a distinct Albanian nation alive.  
On 28 November 1912 Albanian leaders proclaimed independence, but the Great Powers drew the new state’s borders in a way that left large Albanian populations outside it.
</p>

<h2>2. Monarchy, republic and foreign occupation (1912–1944)</h2>
<p>
Between the two world wars Albania experimented with almost every regime type: an independent principality (1912-14), a monarchy under Prince Wilhelm (1914), a republic led by Ahmet Zogu (1925-28), and a royal dictatorship under King Zog I (1928-39).  
In 1939 Mussolini’s Italy invaded; after Italy’s 1943 collapse German troops took over.  
A communist-led National Liberation Movement fought the occupiers and emerged as the strongest domestic force by 1944.
</p>

<h2>3. Birth of the People’s Socialist Republic (1944–1991)</h2>
<p>
Partisan commander Enver Hoxha formed a provisional government in 1944.  
On 10 January 1946 a Soviet-style constitution turned Albania into the People’s Socialist Republic of Albania, a rigid one-party state run by the Albanian Party of Labour.  
Hoxha broke successively with Yugoslavia (1948), the USSR (1961) and finally China (1978), leaving Albania diplomatically isolated.  
The regime built hundreds of thousands of concrete bunkers and sealed the borders, turning the country into what many called “the North Korea of Europe.”
</p>

<h2>4. Life under Hoxha’s rule</h2>
<p>
Collectivisation of agriculture and sweeping nationalisations wiped out private property.  
A Sigurimi secret-police network penetrated every village and workplace; political opponents were jailed, exiled or executed.  
Religion was banned outright in 1967—Albania proclaimed itself the world’s first atheist state, closing every mosque and church.  
Until the late 1980s private cars were almost non-existent and travel inside the country required permits.  
Literacy campaigns and basic health care improved, but at the cost of total suppression of free speech and movement.
</p>

<h2>5. Collapse and transition (1990-1991)</h2>
<p>
Economic stagnation, mounting foreign debt and the example of change elsewhere in Eastern Europe sparked protests in 1990.  
The Labour Party legalised other parties in December 1990; the first multi-party elections were held in March 1991.  
On 29 April 1991 the communist constitution was formally scrapped, ending 45 years of one-party rule.
</p>

<h2>6. Aftermath</h2>
<p>
The communist legacy still shapes Albania: the concrete bunkers dot the landscape, many public buildings carry socialist-realist slogans, and the political scene is dominated by parties that grew out of the old regime and its opponents.  
A new democratic constitution was adopted by referendum in November 1998, anchoring Albania’s current parliamentary republic.

            <h3>Enver Hoxha</h3>
            <p>Enver Hoxha (1908–1985) was an Albanian communist revolutionary and statesman who was the leader of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985. As the First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania,
                 he ruled for four decades, transforming the country into an industrialized economy with one of Europe's most tightly controlled and isolated societies</p>

            <h3>Gjergj Kastrioti</h3>
            <p>Gjergj Kastrioti, commonly known as Skanderbeg, is the national hero of Albania, celebrated for leading a nearly 25-year resistance against the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. His strategic brilliance and unwavering commitment to defending his
                 homeland and Christianity earned him widespread fame and the title "Athleta Christi" (Champion of Christ) from three different popes. </p>

            <h3>Greater Albania</h3>
            <p>"Greater Albania" is a term used to describe the irredentist concept of unifying all territories perceived as the national homeland of ethnic Albanians into a single state. The areas claimed typically include current-day Albania, the entirety of Kosovo,
                 the Albanian-majority areas of North Macedonia and Southern Serbia, and parts of Northern Greece (Chameria) and Southern Montenegro.</p>
